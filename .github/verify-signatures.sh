# Verify every bundle in this repo carries a valid publisher signature made by
# the expected key. Runnable locally (./.github/verify-signatures.sh) as well as
# in CI, because the failure this guards against is committed, not built: a
# bundle edited without re-signing looks completely fine until a CONSUMER
# advances its pin, at which point ctxloom WITHHOLDS the bundle and any profile
# inheriting from it silently degrades.
#
# Uses ssh-keygen -Y verify — the standard OpenSSH signature-verification path,
# the same one ctxloom itself validates against — rather than reimplementing
# SSHSIG parsing. -I pins the expected principal, so this catches all three
# failure modes in one call:
#
#   missing .sig        -> reported before we ever shell out
#   stale .sig          -> "incorrect signature" (content moved, signature did not)
#   wrong signing key   -> principal/key mismatch against allowed_signers
